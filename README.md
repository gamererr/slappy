you slap people. thats it.

# how?

to use it do this:
```!slap <@mention someone>```

slapping @here or @everyone is a power move but makes people pissed

you can also do:
```!stats```
to get stats gor slaps and stuff (you can also ping someone to see thier stats)

# when?

future plans:
1. slap count - done!
2. slapped count - done!
3. other stats - done?
4. discord server - done?

# why?

i was told to make this by some guy in a twitch chat (i wasnt the person streaming).
